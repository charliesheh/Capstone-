</head>

<body>
    <p><mark>Data security</mark> is the process of securing data so that unauthorized users</p>
    <p>will not gain access to it. There are three forms of data security. One of</p>
    <p>these forms are to have the ability to authenticate users and check what specific</p>
    <p>data they are authorized to access. The second form is to have a method to secure that</p>
    <p>data using some kind of encryption. The third form is to protect your network, generally</p>
    <p>with a firewall.</p>
    <p>Encryption is a process of encoding information and securing your data using a cryptographic algorithm. </p>
    <p>This process works by converting the original representation of the data (plaintext) into ciphertext. </p>
    <p>A firewall is a network security system that functions to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing</p>
    <p>network traffic. It helps to protect against network threats like viruses, unauthorized access, and</p>
    <p>ransomware.</p>
    </n>
    <p><mark>Data protection</mark> is a collection of strategies and procedues you can utilize</p>
    <p>to secure the integrity, privacy, and availability of your data. It takes a</p>
    <p>combination of technical and administrative measures in order to achieve data</p>
    <p>protection. </p>
