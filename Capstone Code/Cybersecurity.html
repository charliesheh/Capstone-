    <p>Cybersecurity is a field in information technology that practices</p>
    <p>protecting systems and senstive data from digital attacks, information</p>
    <p>information disclosure, theft, breaches, etc.</p>
    </n>
    <p>Cybersecurity is vital, because organizations related to military, government,</p>
    <p>and medical fields collect, process, and store new amounts of data on computers</p>
    <p>and other devices. It is very likely that a large portion of that data is sensitive.</p>
    <p>Examples of sensitive data include credit card information, intellectual property, etc.</p>
    <p>Cybersecurity is a field that is dedicated to protecting that information and the</p>
    <p>systems utilized to store it.</p>
